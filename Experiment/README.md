This folder contains the files that were used to run the experiments in the paper. The functions related to the real-world data sets and creating the splits for the different off-training-set prediction problems are included in the file data.py. There are separate files and folders for the simulation, CGKronRLS and sklearn-style of learning algorithms and deep learning methods. The method provided by Sandor Szedmak is in file ltr_solver_multiview_013.py and its wrapper to the sklearn style in file ltr_wrapper.py. The performance measures on the real-world data sets were calculated by the file performance.py. The function cindex in library RLScore was modified to be suitable for calculating the normalized groupwise C-indices.
