# A-index
This repository contains the code, configurations, and resources required to run the experiments described in the paper: Assignment Index: Performance Evaluation for Interaction
Prediction Methods.
Assignment index a novel measure of prediction
performance both for interaction prediction models and for machine learning algorithms used
for inferring such models.

This repository provides a reproducible environment for the experiments detailed in the paper. It includes:

  1. Implementation of the proposed A-index.
  
  2. Experiment configurations.
  
  3. Data processing scripts.
  
  4. Instructions for running experiments and analyzing results.
