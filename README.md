# A-index
This repository contains the code, configurations, and resources required to run the experiments described in the paper: Assignment Index: Performance Evaluation for Interaction
Prediction Methods.
Assignment index ia a novel measure of prediction
performance both for interaction prediction models and for machine learning algorithms used
for inferring such models.

This repository provides a reproducible environment for the experiments detailed in the paper. It includes:
  Implementation of the proposed methods.
  Experiment configurations.
  Data processing scripts.
  Instructions for running experiments and analyzing results.
